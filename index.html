          <p>
            Dear Emese,
            <br />
            On your special day, I wanted to let you know how much you mean to
            me.
            <br />
            I created this song because, lately, I've been feeling like we don't
            talk every day, but our connection is as strong as ever. We're more
            than friends; we're like sisters.
            <br />
            Enjoy this day to the fullest, and may our bond continue to grow
            stronger.
          </p>
